# Industry-like project experience for Statistics Students

I intend to maintain links to repositories of projects done by the past students of this initiative. This is the first time the students have been introduced to git repos. I suggest students to read and follow the best practices, but the ownership and actual decisions are left to the students. They often remove their work once the project is completed to avoid letting next batches copy their work.

## Delhi University 2019-2021 batch

Some of the projects done by this batch are

* [Bankrupcy prediction](https://github.com/SayakGiri/Bankruptcy_Prediction)
